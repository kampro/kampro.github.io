Hi, my name is Kamil, but mates call me Steve (a weird story, never mind...).
I am an iOS developer, I have always been fascinated about Apple's solutions, but different factors postponed my goal to be a developer of something connected with Apple. I went through many technologies in my life, what was smart in a moment and I was feeling that the technology is promising I was using it (a technology is just a technology, if you can program and know algorithms, it should take several weeks to dive into a new technology), but I always wanted to build something more native and be able to "stroke" the hardware. Several years ago I finally reached my goal, I develop native apps for Apple devices. &#x1F389;  
Why I started this blog, you can read it in [my first post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-11-ishidden-vs-alpha %}). I don't expect a huge audience &#x1F914;, I don't expect an audience at all... I have just felt the need to write the blog.
